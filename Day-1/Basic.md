#  System Design Basics

Welcome to the **System Design** notes.

## ðŸ“˜ Day 1 Topics

## *What is LLD ?*
- LLD -> Low Level Design
> LLD focuses on the internal workings of a system â€” how individual components work and interact, how data flows, and how classes or modules are structured.
- DSA -> Isolated Problem -> Application -> LLD

## *Three pillars of LLD:*
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Reusability

## *LLD VS HLD*
### HLD : High Level Design
    -> Tech Stack (Java/SpringBoot)</br>
    -> DB (SQL/NoSQL)</br>
    -> Server Scale</br>
    -> Cost optimization

- HLD focuses on system architecture.
- LLD focuses on code structure.

## Important
- DSA is the brain of an application.</br>
LLD is the skeleton.
